Output file for flux calculations.  
A flux is positive, if it is directed into positive z-direction (from top to bottom).  
  
The diffusive flux is defined as: -phi * (D_effective + D_bio) * dC/dz 
The advective flux is defined as: phi * omega * C 
The total flux is the sum of the diffusive and the advective  flux. 
  
All fluxes are given in:    [cm * muM / s] 
Or in related units, if not the standard unit system is used.
