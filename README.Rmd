This project attempts to translate algorithms implemented by **Rate Estimation from Concentration (REC)** in matlab code into R code. Some minor changes to the workflow are also intended.

REC was originally developed by Karsten Lettmann ([Lettmann et al. 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272771411000229)) and can be downloaded [here](https://uol.de/icbm/physikalische-ozeanographie-theorie/downloads).






## currently superfluous steps
all commented out code
code commented as not used again
in `operate_property`: error and z_c outputs
`E` in `find mean rates` seems obsolete  
## TODO
- change definition of an object `F` because it could be mistaken for `FALSE`
